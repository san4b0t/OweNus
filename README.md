# **OweNus: Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Lending and Expense Management App**

## **Project Overview**

**OweNus** is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and group expense management platform built for students, families, and friends. It mimics the trust and ease of borrowing from friends while introducing transparency, automation, and security via **blockchain** and **AI**. Developed as part of **NUS Orbital 2025 (Artemis level)**, this app empowers users to split expenses, track loans, evaluate credibility, and plan ahead with intelligent forecasts.

## **Features**

###  **Core Features**

* **Personalized Expense Splitter**: Automatically split costs among users by equal share, income ratio, or custom settings.

* **Real-Time Payment Tracker**: View, update, and manage pending and completed payments live.

* **Payment Deadlines & Reminders**: Set due dates and receive smart notifications for repayments.

###  **Advanced Features**

* **Expense Predictor**: Uses AI (TensorFlow Lite) to forecast upcoming expenses based on past behavior.  
* **Expense Time Boxer**: Aligns expenditures with income and schedules using time-boxing and visual analytics.  
* **Credibility Score Generator**: Generate trust scores based on punctuality and behavior, securely stored on the blockchain.

**Tech Stack**

| Technology | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- |
| **React Native** | Cross-platform mobile development |
| **Firebase** | Real-time DB, authentication, messaging |

| **Solidity** | Smart contracts for lending and repayments |
| **Remix IDE** | Blockchain contract development/testing |
| **TensorFlow Lite** | Expense prediction and analytics |

**Credibility Scoring Logic**

A user's credibility score is calculated by:

* Timeliness of repayments

* Number of successful repayments

* Smart contract verifications of debt settlements

Scores are updated on-chain, making them transparent and immutable.
